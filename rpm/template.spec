%description
Description of the Kobuki model. Provides the model description of Kobuki for
simulation and visualisation. The files in this package are parsed and used by a
variety of other components. Most users will not interact directly with this
package. WARNING: This package is disabled because it cannot be catkinized by
now, as xacro dependency is not catkin still. In the interim we use a unary pre-
catkin stack named kobuki_description.
